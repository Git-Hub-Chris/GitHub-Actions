# Hello GitHub Actions

_Create a GitHub Action and use it in a workflow._

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Start of the course >>>
  Include start button, a note about actions minutes,
  and tell the learner why they should take the course.
  Each step should be wrapped in <details>/<summary>, with an `id` set.
  The start <details> should have `open` as well.
  Do not use quotes on the <details> tag attributes.

**To start this course: [<img width="150" alt="Use this template" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/148581131-555c0fb8-5361-4450-a760-75fa6219a2fc.png">](https://github.com/githublearn/hello-github-actions/generate)**

> We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).<br>
> After you make your own repository, wait about 20 seconds and refresh. I will go to the next step.

Automation is key for streamlining your work processes, and GitHub Actions are the best way to supercharge your workflow.
